{"ABS": ["Generally, in the plumbing industry (it is used a lot in the auto industry because it is so durable) this is black colored plastic pipe and fittings used in drainage, sewer, waste and vents. ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) pipe/fittings and also PVC (see below) plastics have replaced much of the cast iron, lead and steel pipes formerly used for DWV. Important note is that no solvent cement (and primer) can totally 'glue' (solvent weld) ABS to PVC plastic. Under normal conditions, quality ABS (when virgin resins are used) will not crack, chip or peel."],
"ACCESS":["PANEL An opening in the wall or ceiling near the fixture that allows access for servicing the plumbing system."],
"ACRYLIC": ["A thermoplastic used on the surface of bathtubs and whirlpools. Generally comes in sheets and is formed to the shape of the mold (tubs/showers) in the factory. Generally fiberglass is added to the back for strength."],
"ADA":["Governmental guidelines. ADA stands for Americans with Disability Act. These guidelines do tend to change over time. When related to public plumbing, kitchen and bath the intent of the act/rules is to make restrooms, and other public sanitary facilities more easily accessible to those who have some disability such as being blind. Commercial restroom signs with braille are an example of products that we sell largely due to ADA rules."]}
